# CPP-QFCalc
A super simple quadratic formula calculator in C++ to help get to grips with the basics

### I made this program whilst learning the basics and fundamentals of the C++ programming language
You can substitute values a, b, and c in via input and it'll return the values applied to the quadratic formula. Nothing fancy, just thought I'd keep track of my progress by putting it on a repository :D
